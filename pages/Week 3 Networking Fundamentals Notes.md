## Class recap:
- ## Class Notes:
	- ### Analogue
		- Analogue data is in a continuous form
		- It varies smoothly
		- Electronically, an analogue signal is a voltage that is continuously going up and down
		- Analogue signals preserve all the information with no loss. It is, however, difficult and expensive to get a computer to work with analogue data, as well as re-create original data once affect by random noise
	- ### Digital
		- A digital signal is a set of binary numbers that represent
	- ### Hub
		- Provide easy access to network cables (has room for expansion, 4, 8, 16, … ports)
		- Can act as a repeater (repeat the signal to extend the distance limitation of the cable)
		- **Types of Hub**
			- Passive Hub
				- A passive hub serves as a conduit for the data, enabling it to go from one device to another
			- Intelligence Hub
				- Include standard features the enables an administrator to monitor the traffic passing through the hub
			- Switching Hub
				- Reads the destination address of each packet and then forwards the packet to the correct port
	- ### Repeater
		- Are used to extend the max distance of a cable or signal
		- Repeaters overcome the attenuation cause by free-space electromagnetic-field divergence or cable loss
		- Remove the unwanted noise in an incoming signal
		- Repeaters can be used for
			- Wireless communications
			- Satellite communications
			- Celular telephone
	- ### Switch
		- Operate at the data link layer
		- Connect two or more computers or network segments the use the same data link and network protocols
		- They may connect the same or different cabling
		- Can have 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 26, 36, 96…. ports
		- Allows you to control who has access
		- Lets you monitor usage
