## Network Topologies
	- Arrangements or physical layout of computers, cables and other components on the network
	- Computer networks can be categorised according to their shape or topology
	- Each terminal in a network is called a node
	- A central computer controls the network
		- It is known as the host computer
	- Topology of a network is the arrangement of the nodes and the ways they are interconnected
	- **Data can be transmitted around the subnet as below**
		- ### Point-to-point Transmission
			- The data passes through each device in the network
			- If two devices wish to communicate, they must do it indirectly
			- Any intervening devices each devices must have the facility to store the entire message and forward it when the outer channel is free
		- ### Broadcast Channel
			- All devices in the network share a common communication channel
			- Any message sent by a device is received by all devices
			- Message contains the address of the device intended to receive it, so that the other devices can ignore it
	- ### Types of Topologies
		- **Star Topology**
			- Star shape
			- Very common topology for many networks
			- Used with a switch or hub
			- Used in LAN
			- Multiple network ports or Wi-Fi clients
			- Offers centralised resources and management
			- **Pros**
				- Fast performance with few nodes and low network traffic
				- Hub/switch can be upgraded easily
				- Easy to troubleshoot
				- Easy to setup and modify
				- Only the node is affected which has failed, rest of the nodes can work smoothly
			- **Cons**
				- Cost of installation is high
				- Expensive to use
				- If the hub fails, the whole network goes down because all the nodes depend on the hub/switch
				- Performance is based on the speed of the hub/switch
		- **Ring Topology**
			- A number of repeaters are used for ring topology with a large number of nodes
			- Repeaters allow the prevention of data loss when sending data across the network
			- The transmission is unidirectional, but can be made bidirectional by having 2 connections between each network node.
				- Called a dual-ring topology
			- **Pros**
				- Transmitting network is not affected by high traffic or by adding more nodes
				- Cheap to install and expand
			- **Cons**
				- Troubleshooting is difficult in ring topology
				- Adding or deleting the computers disturbs the network activity
		- **Bus Topology**
			- A network type in which every computer and network device is connected to a single cable
			- It transmits data only in one direction
			- Every device is connected to a single cable
			- **Pros**
				- It is cost effective
				- Least amount of cable required for the network
				- Used in small networks
				- It is easy to understand
			- **Cons**
				- Cables fails then whole network fails
				- If network traffic is heavy or nodes are more the performance of the network
				  decreases
				- Cable has a limited length
				- It is slower than the ring topology
		- Mesh/Full Mesh Topology
			- **Mesh Topology**
				- Each station is connected to the nearest stations
				- Quite expensive because each addition of a station
				- Might be more than one path
				- Useful for systems that need half or full connectivity
				- Setup an ad hoc mode to become an access point
			- **Full Mesh Topology**
				- When all nodes must be connected and setup their own ad hoc mode
				- Can communicate all around but wiring is expensive
			- **Pros**
				- Each connection can carry its own data load
				- It is robust
				- Fault is recognized easily
				- Provides security and privacy
			- **Cons**
				- Installation and configuration is difficult
				- Cabling cost is higher
				- Bulk wiring is required
		- Hybrid Topologies
			- Combinations of two or more different topologies
			- WANs sometimes have hybrid topologies because they connect a variety of LAN topologies
		- Tree Topology
			- It has a root node and all other nodes are connected to it forming a hierachy
			- It is also called a hierarchical topology
			- It should at least have three levels to the hierachy
			- Ideals if workstations are located in groups
			- **Pros**
				- Extension of bus and star topologies
				- Expansion of nodes is possible and easy
				- Easily managed and maintained
				- Error detection is easily done
			- **Cons**
				- Heavily cabled
				- Costly
				- Maintenance is more difficult the more nodes you have
				- If the central hub fails, the network fails
