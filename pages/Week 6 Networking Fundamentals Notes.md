## Multiplexing
	- Allows the use of one channel vs needing multiple channels for communication
	- Network use multiplexing for two reasons
		- 1
		- 1
	- Two main categories of multiplexing
		- **Frequency division multiplexing** (FDM)
			- FDM works by making a number of smaller channels from a larger frequency band
			- FDM is sometimes referred to as dividing the circuit 'horizontally'
			- In order to prevent interference between channels, unused frequency bands called guard-bands, used to seperate the channels
				- Commonly 200hz each
		- **Time division multiplexing** (TDM)
			- TDM allows multiple channels to be used by allowing the channels to send data by taking turns
			- TDM is sometimes referred to as dividing the circuit 'vertically'
	- There are many sub categories in FMD
		- **Wave-length division multiplexing** (WDM)
		- **Course WDM** (CWDM)
		- **Dense WDM** (DWDM)
- ## Transmission Types
	- ### Asynchronous Transmission
		- Asynchronous transmission is the transmission of data in which each character is self-contained unit with its own start and stop bits and an uneven interval between them
		- **Each character is sent independently**
		- Sometimes referred to as **start-stop transmission**
		- The start bit is usually a 0 and the stop bit a 1
		- Between transmissions (called 'idle time'), a series of stop bits are sent (series of 11111...)
		- When a new character is sent, the start and stop bits are used for synchronisation
		- Two main characteristics
			- Every character is preceded by a start bit and followed by one or more stop bits
			- Spaces between characters are common
		- ### Parity Checking
			- What is a parity check?
				- A parity check is the process that ensures accurate data transmission between nodes during communication
				- A parity bit is appended to the original data bits to create an even or odd bit number
				- The source then transmits this data via a link, and bit are checked and verified at the destination
				- Data is considered accurate if the cumber of bits (even or odd) matches the number transmitted from the souce
	- ### Synchronous Transmission
		- A data transfer method in which a continuous stream of data signals is accompanied by timing signals (generated by an electronic clock) to...
		- Letters (characters) are transmitted (thousands of bytes) at one time as a block of data which is called a FRAME or PACKET
		- More efficient than Asynchronous transmission (generally less overhead)
		- Asynchronous has three bits of overhead per 10 bits sent. Start, Stop and Parity
		- ### Types of synchronous transmission
			- **Synchronous data link control** (SDLC)
				- SDLC is working in layer 2 which is the data link layer
				- Developed by IBM
				- Bit oriented protocol
				- Fields
					- Flag Fields
						- (01111110) Marks the start and end of the frame or packet (8bits)
					- Address Field
						- Identifies the destination (must be the same length) (8bits)
					- Control Field
						- Used to control the link (8bits)
					- Error correction Field
					- Message Field
			- **High-level data link control** (HDLC)
				- Developed by ISO
				- Similar to SDLC except address and control fields can be longer
				- Has larger 'sliding windows' (that enables changing the number of packets that can be transmitted in the network at one time)
				- Error detection
					- 16bit CRC
					- 32bit CRC
			- **Link access procedure-balanced** (LAP-B)
	- ### Packet
		- Parts of a packet
			- Overhead bits are used for the purpose of error checking, addresses, control, etc (not your data)
			- Data
