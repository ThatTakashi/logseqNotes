## Object
	- A concrete manifestation of an abstraction
	- Something that takes up space in the real or conceptual world and the things you can do with it
- ## Class
	- A description of a set of objects that share the same attributes, operations, relationships and semantics
	- Graphically a class is pictured as a rectangle
	- Objects of a given class are identical in structure and behaviour but contain different data in their attributes
	- ### Types of Classes
		- System or Control class
			- An abstraction of the system that controls the use case
		- Interface or Boundary class
			- A class that passes messages between the controller and the actor
		- Entity class
			- A class that stores data
		- Every activity diagram should generate at least one controller, one interface and several entities classes
	- ### Class Diagram
		- Shows the classes of the system
			- Shows their inter-relationships
